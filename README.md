# ðŸ“š RAG Document Chatbot

## **Description**
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Document Chatbot is an AI-powered tool that allows users to **upload their own documents** (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and interact with a chatbot that answers questions based on the content of those documents. It leverages **vector embeddings** and **lightweight LLMs** to provide fast, context-aware responses without relying on paid APIs.

This project combines **document parsing, vector databases, and a conversational AI interface** into a single, easy-to-use Streamlit app.
